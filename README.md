# Functions and Errors - ETH + AVAX
This program demonstrates thow the require(), assert(), and revert() statements are used in Solidity.

## Description
This program is a contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has one public function simulating a withdrawal transaction. Within the function, the require, assert, and revert() statements are utilized.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Download the raw file of the ReqAssRev.sol file that is in this repository. Head over to the Remix website and upload ReqAssRev.sol in your workspace.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ReqAssRev" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by inputting values as the balance and amount in the withdraw function within the contract. You can observe how varying values affect the balance and whether or not the transaction pushes through if a value is set to 0 or if the amount to be withdrawn is set to be greater than the balance.
